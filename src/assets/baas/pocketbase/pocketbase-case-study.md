## Introduction

[Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) is an open source BaaS Project, which can be seen as Supabase's little cousin.

Note that Pocketbase is still in development at the time of writing (September 2024), and backward compatibility is not something the developers can promise before the project reaches v1.0.0. This means it is not recommended for critical applications, unless you are willing to migrate to newer versions as the project comes along.

## Brief History

## Features

Pocketbase is a BaaS Provider with a SQLite embedded database, realtime subsctiptions, built-in auth management, conveinient dashboard UI and simple API which handles CRUD-actions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).
